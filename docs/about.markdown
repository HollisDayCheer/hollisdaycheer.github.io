I've always been interested in puzzles. That translated to a love of math, sitting at a table with my friends, each bringing their own skillset to work through problems that on the surface seemed unsolvable. That mindset has shifted into a love of programming, where I am able to take part in the same collaborative problem solving environment in order to produce, iterating through to make the most elegant version of a thing.
